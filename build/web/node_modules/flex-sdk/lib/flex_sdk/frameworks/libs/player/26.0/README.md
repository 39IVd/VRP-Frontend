Release Notes
=============

https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_26_air_26_release_notes.html

> Authoring for Flash Player 26
>
> To use the new Flash Player, you will need to target SWF version 37 by passing "-swf-version=37" as an extra compiler argument to the ASC 2.0 compiler.

> Authoring for AIR 26 Update to the AIR 26 namespace
>
> You must update your application descriptor file to the 26 namespace in order to access the new AIR 26 APIs and behavior. If your application does not require the new AIR 26 APIs and behavior, you are not required to update the namespace. However, we recommend all users start using the AIR 26 namespace even if you are not yet taking advantage of the new 26 capabilities. To update the namespace, change the xmlns attribute in your application descriptor to: <application xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/26.0">
