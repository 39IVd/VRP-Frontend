Release Notes
=============

http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_13_air_13_release_notes.html

> Please note that the AIR Runtime and SDK version number has now been increased to 13, bringing it in sync with Flash Player.


> Authoring for Flash Player 13
> 
> To use the new Flash Player, you will need to target SWF version 24 by passing "-swf-version=24" as an extra compiler argument to the ASC 2.0 compiler.
> 
> Authoring for AIR 13 Update to the AIR 13 namespace
> 
> You must update your application descriptor file to the 13 namespace in order to access the new AIR 13 APIs and behavior. If your application does not require the new AIR 13 APIs and behavior, you are not required to update the namespace. However, we recommend all users start using the AIR 13 namespace even if you are not yet taking advantage of the new 13 capabilities. To update the namespace, change the xmlns attribute in your application descriptor to: <application xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/13.0">
