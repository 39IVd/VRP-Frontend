Release Notes
=============

https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_24_air_24_release_notes.html

> Authoring for Flash Player 24
>
> To use the new Flash Player, you will need to target SWF version 33 by passing "-swf-version=34" as an extra compiler argument to the ASC 2.0 compiler.

> Authoring for AIR 24 Update to the AIR 24 namespace
>
> You must update your application descriptor file to the 24 namespace in order to access the new AIR 24 APIs and behavior. If your application does not require the new AIR 24 APIs and behavior, you are not required to update the namespace. However, we recommend all users start using the AIR 24 namespace even if you are not yet taking advantage of the new 24 capabilities. To update the namespace, change the xmlns attribute in your application descriptor to: <application xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/24.0">
