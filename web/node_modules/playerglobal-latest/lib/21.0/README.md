Release Notes
=============

https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_21_air_21_release_notes.html

> Authoring for Flash Player 21
>
> To use the new Flash Player, you will need to target SWF version 32 by passing "-swf-version=32" as an extra compiler argument to the ASC 2.0 compiler.

> Authoring for AIR 21 Update to the AIR 21 namespace
>
> You must update your application descriptor file to the 21 namespace in order to access the new AIR 21 APIs and behavior. If your application does not require the new AIR 21 APIs and behavior, you are not required to update the namespace. However, we recommend all users start using the AIR 21 namespace even if you are not yet taking advantage of the new 21 capabilities. To update the namespace, change the xmlns attribute in your application descriptor to: <application xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/21.0">
