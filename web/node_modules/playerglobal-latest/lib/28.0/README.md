Release Notes
=============

https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_28_air_28_release_notes.html

> Authoring for Flash Player 28
>
> To use the new Flash Player, you will need to target SWF version 39 by passing "-swf-version=39" as an extra compiler argument to the ASC 2.0 compiler.

> Authoring for AIR 28 Update to the AIR 28 namespace
>
> You must update your application descriptor file to the 28 namespace in order to access the new AIR 28 APIs and behavior. If your application does not require the new AIR 28 APIs and behavior, you are not required to update the namespace. However, we recommend all users start using the AIR 28 namespace even if you are not yet taking advantage of the new 28 capabilities. To update the namespace, change the xmlns attribute in your application descriptor to: <application xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/28.0">
