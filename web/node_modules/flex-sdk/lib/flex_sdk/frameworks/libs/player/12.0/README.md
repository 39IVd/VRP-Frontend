Release Notes
=============

http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_12_air_4_release_notes.html

> Authoring for Flash Player 12
> 
> To use the new Flash Player, you will need to target SWF version 23 by passing "-swf-version=23" as an extra compiler argument to the ASC 2.0 compiler.
> 
> Authoring for AIR 4 Update to the AIR 4 namespace
> 
> You must update your application descriptor file to the 4 namespace in order to access the new AIR 3.9 APIs and behavior. If your application does not require the new AIR 4 APIs and behavior, you are not required to update the namespace. However, we recommend all users start using the AIR 4 namespace even if you are not yet taking advantage of the new 4 capabilities. To update the namespace, change the xmlns attribute in your application descriptor to: <application xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/4.0">
